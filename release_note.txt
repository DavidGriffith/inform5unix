                       Inform Library 5/12 Now Out
                       ---------------------------
                            (23 October 1995)

The new release of the Inform library, 5/12, is now available from
ftp.gmd.de (at present in the directory incoming/if-archive).

It has been four months since 5/11, and a considerable number of bugs
have been fixed, mostly obscure parser bugs but several that have come to
fame through the release of "Christminster": 50 changes in all have been
made.

There are powerful new features to handle conversation with non-player
characters.

As usual, the Changes.txt file details alterations.  But see also the
second edition of the Inform Designer's Manual, also out today, which
uses library 5/12 throughout.  All information in the changes file is
included in the new DM, and the DM is a better place to look for details
on the new features.

Many thanks, as ever, to all those who reported bugs.

  Graham Nelson
