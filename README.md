**Welcome to Inform!**
=======================

Inform is an Interactive Fiction (text adventure) game compiler -- it 
takes source code you write and turns it into a game data file which is 
then played using an 'interpreter'.  There are several interpreters 
available which can play Inform games on different machines (e.g. frotz, 
jzip) -- you can probably obtain one from the same place you got this 
package.

Inform was originally written by Graham Nelson, and you are free to 
redistribute it under certain conditions -- see the file COPYING for 
details.


Inform5
-------

This archive was created to provide a quick and easy way to use Inform5.  
This is little more than the framework from 
https://github.com/DavidGriffith/inform6unix reworked to build Inform5.  
Inform5 is now a historical curiosity, but still worthy of preservation.
